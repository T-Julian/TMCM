<h1>Taylor-Made Customer Management</h1>

A simple C# - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Application

With Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) there are four pillars -

<b>Identifying Classes</b> = Represents business entities | Defines properties (data) | Defines methods (actions/behavior)

<b>Seperating Reponsibilities</b> = Maximizes cohesion | Minimizes coupling | Simplifies Maintenance | Improves Testability

<b>Establishing Relationships</b> = Defines how objects work together to perform the operations of the application

<b>Leveraging Reuse</b> = Involves extracting commonality | Building reusable classes/components
